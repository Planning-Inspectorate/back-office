# Overview

The web application is used to build the PI BackOffice UI and uses the API app to get access to the data required.

The app source code is splitted in three different folders for each different concern, client JS code, server code, CSS styles.

Designs follow the [GDS Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) in full, using the styles, JS and NJ templates and macros.
