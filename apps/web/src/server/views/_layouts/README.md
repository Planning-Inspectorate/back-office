# NJ Layouts

## Best practices creating layouts

All new layouts should extend the `layout-base.njk` bas layout file.

There shouldn't be any other layer in between layouts withing this generic layouts folder.

## Existing layouts

| Layout               | File                        | Description                                            |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| layout-base          | `layout-base.njk `          | Main layout that contains the base html for every page |
| layout two thirds    | `layout-two-thirds.njk`     | Use to display a page with 1 column that is 2/3 of the full width of the page |
