## Usage

To run the tests, you can run `npm run e2e` from the root, or `npm run e2e:open` to run in interactive mode. 

You can also run `npm run cy:run` and `npm run cy:open` to run in interactive mode from the e2e-testing - `/back-office/apps/e2e`` directory.

## Environment Variables

There is a sample `.env.sample` file which will show you all the required environment variables. Make sure to set those variables in order for the tests to run properly.
